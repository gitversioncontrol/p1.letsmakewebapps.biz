<b> <h1> Welcome to my page for project 1 of CSCIE 15 </h1> </b>
<p>
My name is Harpreet Singh and I'm a Software Engineer trying to gain Web Development skills through this course.
<br>Eclipse IDE was used to create this page but I'm trying my hands on Sublime too.Eclipse is great and I have been using it to develop Java programs but it consumes a big chunk of resources on my PC.

<p style="float: left; clear: left">
I wouldn't call myself a web-developer yet but I could definitely relate to them.
