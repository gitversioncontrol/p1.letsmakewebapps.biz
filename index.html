<h1> Welcome to my page for project 1 of CSCIE 15 </h1>

<p>
My name is Harpreet Singh and I'm a Software Engineer trying to gain Web Development skills through this course.Before this one,I have taken Distributed Java computing and Oracle DBA courses at HES and found them equally interesting. 
<br>Eclipse IDE was used to create this page,though I'm trying my hand on Sublime too.Eclipse is great and I have been using it to develop Java programs but it consumes a big chunk of resources on my PC.

No doubt I'm totally excited to join this course but here is the story of our lives.
I'm sure we all could relate to this image.
